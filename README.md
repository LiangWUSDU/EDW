# EDW
 Introducing exponential-distance weighted(EDW) for reducing grid-like artifacts
 
 The code was written by Dr. Liang Wu, Shandong University.


We will publish this work, and when we publish it we will upload it here.

keywords: patch fusion, EDW, distance, registration

# Instructions

Keras

Tensorflow

## Files

patch_fusion.py: This is our original code, it is flexible to modify, but the fusion time is very long.

patch_fusion_fast.py: Code for fast implementation.

patch_fusion_AAW.py: AAW method
